  "review": "Great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.\n\nThis is probably one of the best assassin movies I've ever seen (\"Smokin' Aces\", \"Kill Me Three Times\" and \"Hanna\" come to mind as others), the best thing it does is be refreshing, normally when a \"character comes home after a long time away\" trope happens, it's all about re-integrating, and how that affects the family, and it becomes a dark dramedy about dysfunctional families.\n\nI'm not saying it doesn't to that, to a degree, but it does it in a spectacular way, and keeps it brief. It would actually be a solution to the main adversity of the movie, but because the premise is that she drags her work home with her, it's all about survival.\n\nJessica Chastain, Colin Ferrell, and (especially) John Malkovich do an amazing job on rather down to Earth (if a bit psychotic and brutal) action sequences.\n\nWhile there is a lot going on around the story, the real focus, and it's worth it, her just trying to live through the organization she joined which she knows has to end in either her or the company's death.\n\nI do feel like the worst of it is just that Diana Silvers sort of got sidelined, but I'm hoping that the sequel will focus on her quite a bit."
